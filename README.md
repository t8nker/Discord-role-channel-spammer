# DiscordRole-Channel-spammer
These are simple bot commands my friend wanted so he could mess with a server. but not totally destory it 

The bot needs admin to work, if you're really commited you can disguise your bot  to look legit and send the invite link to  the owner or someone with admin. then run the commands.

Use at your own risk.
